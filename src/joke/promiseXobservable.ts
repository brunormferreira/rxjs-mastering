// ANNOTATIONS

/*
In a nutshell, the main differences between a Promise and an Observable are as follows:

* a Promise is eager, whereas an Observable is lazy,
* a Promise is always asynchronous, while an Observable can be either synchronous or
asynchronous. Even if itâ€™s immediatelly resolved.
* a Promise can provide a single value, whereas an Observable is a stream of values
(from 0 to multiple values), you can apply RxJS operators to an Observable to get a
new tailored stream.
